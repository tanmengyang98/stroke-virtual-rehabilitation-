## 🎯 The Problem

Stroke is a leading cause of disability in Malaysia, with over 50,000 new cases annually. However:
- Only 30% of stroke survivors have access to rehabilitation facilities
- Traditional rehab requires expensive equipment and trained physiotherapists
- Rural areas lack adequate rehabilitation infrastructure
- Home-based rehab lacks real-time feedback and guidance

## 💡 The Solution

A web-based platform that uses computer vision to guide stroke patients through upper limb rehabilitation exercises using just a webcam - no special equipment needed.

### Key Features
- ✅ **Markerless tracking**: No sensors or wearables required
- ✅ **Real-time feedback**: Immediate guidance on movement quality
- ✅ **Low-spec hardware**: Runs on basic laptops/tablets (minimum requirement I3)
- ✅ **Clinically validated**: Exercise modules based on established therapeutic protocols
- ✅ **Accessible**: Web-based, works anywhere with internet

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML5, CSS3
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js
- **Computer Vision**: MediaPipe, TensorFlow.js
- **Deployment**: [Your deployment platform]

## 👥 Target Users

1. **Primary**: Stroke survivors doing home-based rehabilitation
2. **Secondary**: Community clinics without physiotherapy equipment
3. **Tertiary**: Caregivers supporting stroke patients at home

## 📊 Current Status

**Phase 1 (Current)**: Validation of therapeutic exercise modules
- ✅ Literature review of stroke rehabilitation protocols
- ✅ Exercise module design
- 🔄 Clinical validation study (in progress)
- ⏳ System development
- ⏳ User testing

## 🔬 Methodology



## 📈 Expected Impact

- Reduce rehabilitation equipment costs by 90%
- Enable scalable rehab access to rural areas
- Provide objective movement assessment data
- Support continuity of care between clinic and home

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

- [ ] Complete Phase 1 validation
- [ ] Develop full system prototype
- [ ] Clinical pilot study with 20-30 patients
- [ ] Integration with hospital EMR systems
- [ ] Mobile app version

## 📝 Research Output

- Master's Thesis (Expected: September 2026)
- Conference paper submission
