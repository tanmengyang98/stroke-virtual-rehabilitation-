## 🎯 The Problem

**Stroke rehabilitation in Malaysia faces critical barriers:**

- 🏥 Only **30% of stroke survivors** have access to rehabilitation facilities
- 💰 Traditional rehab requires **expensive equipment** (RM50,000+ per setup)
- 👨‍⚕️ Shortage of **physiotherapists**, especially in rural areas
- 🏘️ **Rural communities** (like parts of Johor and Melaka) have minimal rehab infrastructure
- 📍 Patients must travel long distances for regular therapy sessions

**Clinical Reality from My Experience:**
During my housemanship at Hospital Melaka, I witnessed stroke patients being discharged with rehabilitation plans they couldn't follow due to lack of access or resources, but the main limitation remains to be logistical barrier.
